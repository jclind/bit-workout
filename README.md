I've always been inspired by the way that [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) uses turns boring everyday todo tasks into an exciting RPG adventure where you collect items, upgrade your character, and fight monsters along with your clan. Growing up this website gave me so much motivation to complete all of my chores and tasks.
So there came along my idea to implement a similar idea in a workout app because, lets face it, we can all use some added motivation to exercise!
